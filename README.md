# AdditionalTimelines
An add-on to FStats that shows additional timelines similar to the skill timeline.

## Key-like Charms
Key-like charms (Spore Shroom, Defender's Crest, Fragile Heart/Greed/Strength) will appear on the key timeline if the check(s) that they unlock have been randomized (Lore Tablets/Mr. Mushroom, Rancid Eggs, and Charms, respectively). The option to show these charms may be turned off in the global settings.

Note that key-like charms may not display correctly on the key timeline if you are using custom pools.

## Toggling Timelines
By default, both the key timeline and stag timeline will be displayed. Whether they are displayed or not is changeable in the global settings.

Changes to the global settings will apply retroactively to existing saves (assuming the mod was installed when the save was created).
